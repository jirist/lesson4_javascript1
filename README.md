### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. Variable declaration and initialization (creating a variable in javascript is called declaring, storing a value in a variable is called initialization) and the importance of using good naming conventions (for example, variable name should be descriptive, written using "camelCase" method).
2. Accessing and manipulating HTML elements using HTML DOM getElementById() method; since an ID is unique within a page, the most common way to access an element in the DOM is by matching the value of the ID attribute.
3. Converting a value from numeric string to a floating-point decimal number using parseFloat() method; if the string does contain a parsable float, the result of parseFloat method is a number found in the string.
