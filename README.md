### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. Variable declaration and initialization (creating a variable in javascript is called declaring, storing a value in a variable is called initialization) and the importance of using good naming conventions (for example, the variable name should be descriptive, written using "camelCase" method).
2. Accessing and manipulating HTML elements using HTML DOM getElementById() method; since an ID is unique within a page, the most common way to access an element in the DOM is by matching the value of the ID attribute. Each element in an HTML document is part of a document object model (DOM) for that document, so they can be accessed (and manipulated) using the DOM and a JavaScript.
3. Converting a value from numeric string to a floating-point decimal number using parseFloat() method; if the string does contain a parsable float, the result of the parseFloat method is a number found in the string.
4. The relationship between an event (user clicks a button on a webpage) and an event handler (block of code - defined JavaScript function); when an event occurs, the handler is run (the event handler is registered) in response to it happening.
